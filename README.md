### 2. Prisma Workflow Enhancements

These features activate when viewing the Prisma web app and can be managed via the **Settings** page:

| Setting Name | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Replace Prisma Logo** | Replaces the standard Prisma logo with the extension's custom icon in the UI, indicating the extension is active. |
| **'Add Campaign' auto clicks 'Enter Full Details'** | Automatically redirects a campaign creation URL to bypass the simplified 'light-box' option, defaulting to the full details page. |
| **Hide unused sections on 'Add Campaign'** | Hides the **Objective**, **Targeting**, and **Flighting** sections on the 'Add Campaign' page for a cleaner interface. |
| **Automate 'Budget type' and 'Media mix' selection** | Automatically sets the 'Media Mix' field to **Digital** (`media_digital`) and 'Budget Type' to **Total Cost** (`3`) on the 'Add Campaign' form. |

### 3. Contextual Reminders

The extension monitors page content and URLs in real-time to display critical, non-dismissable popups:

* **Meta Reconciliation Reminder:** Shows a reminder popup on the Prisma 'actualize' page when specific text conditions for Meta reconciliation are detected (`000770` and `Redistribute all`).
* **IAS Booking Reminder:** Shows a reminder popup when specific conditions for IAS booking are detected (`001148`, `Flat`, and `Unit Type`).
* **Custom Reminders:** Allows users to create their own custom reminders triggered by a **URL pattern** (supporting wildcards `*`) and optional **page text trigger**.
* **Timesheet Reminder (Aura):** A recurring notification alarm that can be configured to trigger on a specific **Day** and **Time** (e.g., Friday at 14:30), with a snooze option.

### 4. Approver Management Tools

A dedicated tool set for handling Prisma approver emails:

* **Prisma Approver Search Page:** A separate HTML page (`approvers.html`) providing a searchable, filterable list of all approvers. Users can filter by **Business Unit**, **Client/Office Name**, and a **Favourites Only** toggle.
* **Approve/Copy Integration:** Users can select multiple approvers, copy their emails to the clipboard, and save them as favourites directly from the search tool.
* **One-Click Paste in Prisma:** On Prisma approval pages, buttons are injected next to the 'To' field to:
    * **Paste Approvers:** Automatically pastes a semi-colon delimited list of emails from the clipboard into the Prisma search field, selecting and adding each one sequentially.
    * **Paste Favourites:** Automatically pastes all saved favourite approver emails.

### 5. Meta Billing Check Utility

* **Meta Billing Check:** A button in the extension popup that, when clicked on the **Meta Ads Manager campaigns page**, injects a script to scrape and download campaign data (including Campaign Name, Start/End Dates, Impressions, Budget, and Amount Spent) as a CSV file.
